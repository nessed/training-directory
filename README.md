# trainers-directory
first unique arrays made for certifications and expertise
expertise predicate function has trainer as a parameter as this might be modified
if selected expertise is null then it returns true aka trainer passed the filter 
else if not null and there is a filter added for example "Motivation", it will loop through trainer.trainingexpertise to see if some (any) values match motivation, if so it will return true, but doesn't that make it contradictory as if there is no selectedexpertise it also returns true
